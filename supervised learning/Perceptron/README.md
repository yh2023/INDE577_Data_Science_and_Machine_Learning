#  Perceptron

The Perceptron is a basic neural network algorithm that can be used for binary classification tasks, which involves separating two classes of data points based on a decision boundary. The Perceptron was introduced in the late 1950s by Frank Rosenblatt and is one of the oldest and simplest types of artificial neural networks.


## Dataset

In the case of the Perceptron dataset, it is typically designed to be a two-dimensional dataset consisting of two classes of data points. It is a dataset that has been created specifically to test the performance of the Perceptron algorithm generated using computer programs.
