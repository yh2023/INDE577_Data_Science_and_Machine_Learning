# Gradient Descent

  
Gradient descent is a widely used optimization algorithm in machine learning for minimizing the cost function of a model. It is used to update the model parameters (coefficients) iteratively by moving in the direction of steepest descent of the cost function.

-  Batch Gradient Descent
-  Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Mini-batch Gradient Descent

## Dataset

**Columns**
-   age: age of primary beneficiary
-   sex: insurance contractor gender, female, male
-   bmi: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height, objective index of body weight (kg / m^2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9
-   children: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents
-   smoker: Smoking
-   region: the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.
