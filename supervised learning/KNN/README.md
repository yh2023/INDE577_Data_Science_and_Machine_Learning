#  k-Nearest Neighbors

K-Nearest Neighbors is a popular type of supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression analysis.

In KNN, the algorithm predicts the class of an instance by looking at the k nearest neighbors in the training data. The value of k is a hyperparameter that needs to be chosen by the user. The algorithm uses a distance metric, such as Euclidean distance or Manhattan distance, to measure the similarity between the instance and its neighbors in the feature space.


## Dataset
the wine dataset is one of the built-in datasets available in scikit-learn. It is a classic classification dataset that consists of the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy, but derived from three different cultivars. The dataset contains 178 samples, each with 13 features that describe the chemical composition of the wines, such as alcohol content, malic acid, and ash. The target variable is the class of the wine, which can take on one of three possible values representing the different cultivars.
