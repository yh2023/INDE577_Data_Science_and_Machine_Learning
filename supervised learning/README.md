# Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data, where the input features and output labels are known. The goal of supervised learning is to learn a mapping from input features to output labels that can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data.

## Advantages:

1.  Accuracy: Supervised learning algorithms can achieve high accuracy in predicting outputs once they are trained on labeled data.
    
2.  Efficiency: Once trained, the model can make predictions quickly and can handle large datasets.
    
3.  Generalization: Supervised learning models can generalize well to unseen data, meaning they can accurately predict outcomes for data that they have not been trained on.
    

## Disadvantages:

1.  Need for Labeled Data: Supervised learning requires labeled data for training, which can be expensive and time-consuming to obtain.
    
2.  Overfitting: Overfitting can occur when a model is too complex, resulting in the model fitting the training data too closely and not generalizing well to new data.
    
3.  Limited Applicability: Supervised learning algorithms work well only for specific problems where labeled data is available, and may not work as well for problems where data is unlabeled or the relationship between input and output is not well-defined.
    
4.  Bias: Supervised learning models can be biased towards certain outcomes based on the bias present in the training data, which can lead to unfair predictions and decision-making.
