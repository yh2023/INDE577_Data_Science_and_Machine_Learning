#  Ensemble Learning

Ensemble learning is a machine learning technique that combines the predictions of multiple individual models to improve the accuracy and robustness of the overall prediction. The individual models in the ensemble are called base models, and they can be of the same or different types, using different algorithms or hyperparameters.

**Methods**
- Voting Classifiers
- Bagging and Pasting
- Random Forest

## Dataset
The dataset is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD).The dataset provides the patients’ information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes.

**Information on current medical condition**
- Tot Chol: total cholesterol level
- Sys BP: systolic blood pressure
- Dia BP: diastolic blood pressure
- BMI: Body Mass Index
- Heart Rate: heart rate - In medical research, variables such as heart rate though in fact discrete, yet are considered continuous because of large number of possible values.
- Glucose: glucose level
- Target variable to predict
- TenYearCHD: 10 year risk of coronary heart disease (binary: “1:Yes”, “0:No”)
The dataset is a public dataset describe some variables influencing medical insurance charge. The dataset has 8 columns and 1338 rows.
