#  Decision Trees


A decision tree is a popular supervised learning algorithm used in machine learning and data mining. It is a type of model that uses a tree-like graph or model of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs, and utility.


## Dataset
[Car Evaluation Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/car+evaluation) was derived from a simple hierarchical decision model originally developed for the demonstration of DEX, M. Bohanec, V. Rajkovic: Expert system for decision making. Sistemica 1(1), pp. 145-157, 1990.). The model evaluates cars according to the following concept structure:  
  
- CAR: car acceptability  
- PRICE: overall price  
- buying: buying price  
- TECH: technical characteristics  
- COMFORT: comfort  
- doors: number of doors  
- persons: capacity in terms of persons to carry  
- lug_boot: the size of luggage boot  
- safety: estimated safety of the car
